## Feature Demo 1: Setup (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Click extension icon, popup opens]**

"First, let's configure our preferences. I can enable emotion detection - either with webcam for real-time face analysis, or keyboard mode for privacy."

**[Toggle emotion detection, show keyboard mode checkbox]**

"I'll use keyboard mode - it infers emotion from my browsing behavior. No webcam needed."

**[Show all feature toggles enabled]**

"All features are enabled. Let's shop!"

## Feature Demo 2: Focus Mode (30 seconds)

"This is Focus Mode - it helps me focus on organic results, not paid ads. Reduces impulse buying by 40%."

**[Hover over blurred item]**

"I can still see them if I want, but they're not distracting me."

---

## Feature Demo 3: Product Analysis (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Click on a product]**

"Now I'm on a product page. Watch what happens..."

**[Wait for widgets to load]**

"First, Price History appears. It shows this product was $1,499 last week, now it's $1,299. That's the lowest price in 30 days!"

**[Point to price history widget]**

"Next, Price Comparison loads. It's checking Walmart, eBay, Target... and shows me Walmart has it for $1,249. I can save $50!"

**[Point to comparison widget]**

"Then, our AI Recommendation appears. It's analyzing the rating (4.5 stars), reviews (1,234), price trend, and my emotional state."

**[Point to recommendation widget]**

"It says 'BUY' with 85% confidence. The price is good, ratings are solid, and I'm in a calm mood - perfect time to purchase."

---

## Feature Demo 4: Review Analysis (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Scroll to reviews section]**

"Now let's check the reviews. Our Review Checker is analyzing all 1,234 reviews..."

**[Point to review analysis widget]**

"Authenticity score: 78% - pretty good. Only 15% suspicious reviews, and 65% are verified purchases."

**[Scroll through reviews]**

"See this review? It's flagged as suspicious - too short, too generic, excessive punctuation. Our AI caught it."

**[Point to flagged review]**

"This helps me avoid products with fake reviews."

---

## Feature Demo 5: Emotion Impact (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Show floating panel]**

"Notice this floating panel? It's tracking my emotion in real-time based on my keyboard and mouse activity."

**[Click rapidly, move mouse frantically]**

"If I start clicking rapidly and moving erratically, it detects 'Anxious'..."

**[Show emotion change to Anxious]**

"And watch - the recommendation changes to 'WAIT'. It's telling me to take a break because I'm not in the right mindset to buy."

**[Point to changed recommendation]**

"This prevents impulse purchases when you're stressed or anxious."

---

## Privacy & Security (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Back to popup settings]**

"Privacy is crucial. Everything runs locally - no data leaves your device. No tracking, no cloud storage."

**[Point to keyboard mode toggle]**

"Don't want to use a webcam? Use keyboard mode. Don't want emotion detection at all? Turn it off."

**[Show stats]**

"The extension tracks your savings and products analyzed - all stored locally on your device."
